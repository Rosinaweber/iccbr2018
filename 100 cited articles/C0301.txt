The database will also contain estimates of the relative frequency of senses and mentation patterns calculated by matching tile senses and patterns in the hand-tagged exam-ples against the entire BNC corpus.  1.2 Conceptual Model The FrameNet work is in some ways similar to efforts to describe the argument structures of lexical items in terms of case-roles or theta-roles, 5 but in FrameNet, the role names (called frame elements or FEs) are local to particular conceptual structures (frames); some of these are quite general, while others are specific to a small family of lexical items. For example, the TRANSPORTATION frame,  within the domain of MOTION, provides MOVERS, MEANS of transportation, and PATHS; 6  4In cases of accidental gaps, clearly marked invented examples may be added.  ~The semantic frames for individual lexical units are typically "blends" of more than one basic frame; from our point of view, the so-called "linking" patterns posed in LFG, HPSG, and Construction Grammar, erate on higher-level frames of action (giving agent, tient, instrument), motion and location (giving theme, location, source, goal, path), and experience (giving periencer, stimulus, content), etc. In some but not all cases, the assignment of syntactic correlates to frame ements could be mediated by mapping them to the roles of one of the more abstract frames.  6A detailed study of motion predicates would require a finer-grained analysis of the Path element, separating out Source and Goal, and perhaps Direction and Area, but for a basic study of the transportation predicates such refined analysis is not necessary. In any case, our  subframes associated with individual words herit all of these while possibly adding some of their own. Fig. 1 shows some of the subframes, as discussed below.  fr alne (TRA N S P-ORTATIO N)  scene(MOVER(S) move along PATH by MEANS)  sceneS(DRIVER starts VEHICLE, DRIVER  COntrois VEHICLE~ DRIVER stops VEHICLE) ~(RIDfNG_I)  VEItICLE carries RIDER along PATH,  Figure 1: A subframe can inherit elements and semantics from its parent  The DRIVING frarue, for example, specifies a DRIVER (a principal MOVER), 3 VEHICLE (a par-ticularization of tile MEANS element), and po-tentially CARGO or RIDER as secondary movers. In this frame, tile DRIVER initiates and controls the movement of the VEHICLE. For most verbs in this frame, DRIVER or VEHICLE can be ized as subjects; VEHICLE, RIDER, or CARGO can appear as direct objects; and PATH and VEHICLE can appear as oblique complements.  Some combinations of frame elements, or Frame Element Groups (FEGs), for some real corpus sentences in the DRIVING frame are shown in Fig. 2.  A RIDING_I frame has the primary mover role as RIDER~ and allows as VEHICLE those driven by others, z In grammatical realizations of this frame, the RIDER can be the subject; the CLE can appear as a direct object or an oblique complement; and the PATH is generally realized as an oblique.  The PrameNet entry for each of these verbs will include a concise formula for all  semanwork includes the separate analysis of the frame tics of directional and locational expressions.  7A separate frame RIDING_2 that applies to the glish verb ride selects means of transportation that can be straddled, such as bicycles, motorcycles, and horses.

The syntactic positions considered relevant for lexicographic description include those that are internal to the maximal projection of the target word (the whole VP, AP, or NP for target V, A or N), and those that are external to the max-imal projection under precise structural tions; the subject, in the case of VP, and the subject of support verbs in the case of AP and NP. s  Used in NLP, the FrameNet database should make it possible for a system which finds a valence-bearing lexical item in a text to know (for each of its senses) where its individual ments are likely to be found. For example, once a parser has found the verb drive and its direct object NP, the link to the DRIVING frame will suggest some semantics for that NP, e.g. that a person as direct object probably represents the RIDER, while a non-human proper noun is probably the VEHICLE.  For practical lexicography, the contribution of the FrameNet database will be its presentation  SFor causatives, the object of the support verb is included; for details, see (Fillmore and Atkins, forthcoming).  of the full range of use possibilities for ual words, documented with corpus data, the model examples for each use, and the statistical information on relative frequency.  2 Organization and Workflow  The computational side of the FrameNet project is directed at efficiently capturing human in-sights into semantic structure. The majority of the work involved is marking text with se-mantle tags, specifying (again by hand) the structure of the frames to be treated, and ing dictionary-style entries based the results of annotation and a priori descriptions. With the exception of the example sentence extrac-tion component, all the software modules are highly interactive and have substantial user terface requirements. Most of this functionality is provided by WWW-based programs written in PERL.  Four processing steps are required produce the FrameNet database of frame semantic resentations: (a) generating initial descriptions of semantic and syntactic patterns for use in corpus queries and annotation ("Preparation"),  (b) extracting good example sentences ("Sub-corpus Extraction"), (c) marking (by hand) the constituents of interest ("Annotation"), and (d) building a database of lexical semantic tations based on the annotations and other data ("Entry Writing"). These are discussed briefly below and shown in Fig. 3.  2.2 Workflow and Personnel As work on the project has progressed, we have defined several explicit roles which project participants play in the various steps, these roles are referred to as Vanguard (1..1 in Fig. 3), Annotators (3,1) and Rearguard (4.1). These are purely functional designations:  the same person may play different roles at ferent times. 9  1. Preparation. The Vanguard (1.1) pre-pares the initial descriptions of frames, ing lists of frames and frame elements, and adds these to the Frame Database (5.1) using the Frame Description tool (1.2). The Vanguard  9Of course there are other staff members who write code and maintain the databases. This scenes work is not shown in Fig. 3.  ___ ""1 ~ / Annotated ~ I Entry [ Sentences If~Writlng Vanguard 1.1 :--~ ~ \ 5.3 / ~ Tools ~ 4.2 4,1  Rearguard  Figure 3: Workflow, Roles, Data Structures and Software  also selects the major vocabulary items for the frame (the target words) and the syntactic terns that need to be checked for each word, which are entered in the Lexical Database (5.2) by means of the Lexical Database Tool (1.3).  2. Subcorpus Extraction. Based oil the Vanguard's work, the subcorpus extraction tools (2.2) produce a representative collection of sentences containing these words.  This selection of examples is achieved through a hybrid process partially controlled by the liminary lexical description of each lemma. tences containing the lemma are extracted from from a corpus and classified into subcorpora by syntactic pattern (2.2.1) using a CASCADE FILTER (2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.6) representing a tial regular-expression grammar of English over part-of-speech tags (cf. Gahl (forthcoming)), formatted for annotation (2.2.4) , and ically sampled (2.2.3) down to an appropriate number.  (If these heuristics fail to find appropriate examples by means of syntactic patterns, sen-tences are selected using INTERACTIVE  SELECAnnotation. Using the annotation ware (3.2) and the tagsets (3.2.1) derived from the Frame Database, the Annotators (3.1) mark selected constituents in the extracted subcor-pora according to the frame elements which they realize, and identify canonical examples, novel patterns, and problem sentences. 1  Entry Writing. The Rearguard (4.1) reviews the skeletal lexical record created by the Vanguard, the annotated example sentences (5.3), and the FEGs extracted from them, and builds both the entries for the lemmas in the Lexical Database (5.2) and the frame tions in the Frame Database (5.1), using the Entry Writing Tools (4.2).  1 We are building a "constituent type identifier" which will semi-automatically assign Grammatical Function (GF), and Phrase Type (PT) attributes to these marked constituents, eliminating the need for tors to mark these.  3.1 Data Model The data structures described above are im-plemented in SGML. n Each is described by a  DTD, and these DTDs are structured to provide the necessary links between the components.  3.2 Software The software suite currently supporting database development is an aggregate of existing software tools held together with PERL/CGI-based "glue". In order to get the project started, we have depended on off-the-shelf software which in some cases is not ideal for our purposes. Nevertheless, using these programs allowed us to get the project up and running within just a few months. We describe  below in approximate order of application the programs used and their state of completion.  Frame Description Tool (1.2) (in development) An interactive, web-based tool.  Lexical Description Tool (1.3) (prototype) An interactive, web-based tool.  CQP (2.2.1) is a high-performance Corpus Query Processor, developed at IMS Stuttgart (IMS, 1997). The cascade filter, which partitions specific subcorpora by syntactic patterns, is built using a preprocessor (written in PERL, 2.2.2) which generates CQP's native query language.  XKWIC (2.3) is an X-window, interactive tool, also from IMS, which facilitates manipulating pora and subcorpora.  Subcorpora are prepared for annotation by a program ("arf" for Annotation Ready Formatter, 2.2.4) which wraps SGML tags around sentences, target words, comments and other distinguishable text elements. Another program, "whittle" (2.2.3), combines subcorpora in a preselected order, ing very long and very short sentences, and sampling to reduce large subcorpora.  Alembic (3.2) (Mitre, 1998), allows the active markup (in SGML) of text files according to predefined tagsets (3.2.1). It is used to introduce frame element annotations into the subcorpora.  Sgmlnorm, etc. (from James Clark's SGML tool set) are used to validate and manage the SGML files.  Entry Writing Tools (4.2) (in development)  Database management tools to manage the alog of subcorpora, schedule the work, render the  nEventually, we plan to migrate to an XML data model, which appears to provide more flexibility while reducing complexity. Also, the FrameNet software is ing developed on Unix, but we plan to provide cross-platform capabilities by making our tool suite web-based and XML-compatible.  SGML files into HTML for convenient viewing on the web, etc. are being written in PERL. RCS tains version control over most files.  4 Conclusion At the time of writing, there is something in place for each of the major software compo-nents, though in some cases these are little more than stubs or "toy" implementations. Nearly 10,000 sentences exemplifying just under 200 lemmas have been annotated; there are over 20,000 frame element tokens marked in these example sentences. About a dozen frames have been specified, which refer to 47 named frame elements. Most of these annotations have been accomplished in the last few months since the software for corpus extraction, frame tion, and annotation became operational. We expect the inventory to increase rapidly. If the proportions cited hold constant as the Framenet database grows, the final database of 5,000 ical units may contain 250,000 annotated sen-tences and over half a million tokens of frame elements.
